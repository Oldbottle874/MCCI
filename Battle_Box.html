  	    <h1>Battle Box</h1>
  	    <p>An epic PvP-centric game that occurs over 3 rounds.
  	    Each team cycles round and plays against every other team in a 4v4 match up!
  	    Teams have 1 minute, and only 1 life to capture the centre objective before the other team.
  	    </p>

  	    <h1>Goal</h1>
  	    <p>Battle Box's main goal is to win the round by either placing the team's wool blocks completely at the centre of the map or having the most amount of the team's wool blocks at the centre.
  	    Killing the opposing players is not required, but will award some coins.
  	    Each team will have 3 rounds each against other teams.
