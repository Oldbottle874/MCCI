	    <h1>Sky Battle</h1>
	    <p>All players begin on the spawn island.
	    Gather resources, craft, and eliminate your opponents to survive. 
	    There are three rounds total, and each round lasts four minutes.
	    You only get one life so don't do anything stupid. (Yes, falling will kill you).
	    Over time, the map borders begin to decrease.
	    This is marked out by a particle border.
	    Red = Dead.
	    Luckily, everyone has an infinite amount of concrete, so there is plenty of opportunities to get creative!

	    <h1>Goal</h1>
	    <p>Sky Battle is a fast-paced PVP game, that involves communication throughout the team, survival, and getting kills.
	    The goal is to be the last team standing in each round.
	    There are a total of 3 rounds in total which lasts 4 minutes each.
	    As time goes by, the circular border will shrink from the sides and the top.
	    </p>
	    <p>Resources that competitors would need are scattered around the map, from the team's starting islands to the center of the map.
	    Players can find melee weapons, bows, crossbows, TNT, creeper eggs, and fishing rods to help rack up kills.
	    There are also cobwebs and iron blocks to improve your chances of survival.
