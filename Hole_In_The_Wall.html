	    <p>The aim of the game is to remain the last team standing as large walls of slime converge on you from all directions!
	    Jump and thread your way through the walls without being pushed off the platform.
	    </p>
	    <p>Over time, the speed of the walls will increase, as well as the platform beneath you decreasing in size!
	    Coins are awarded every time a player falls and youâ€™re still on the platform, with a big bonus if you survive an entire round.

	    <h1>Goal</h1>
	    <p>Hole In The Wall is an obstacle-based parkour game with 3 rounds lasting 3 minutes each.
	    In each round, contestants are spawned on a platform in the center of the map, and they must avoid being thrown off by incoming slime walls by jumping or walking through holes embedded within those walls.
	    As the game progresses, the platform shrinks, and the walls arrive at increasingly rapid speeds with greater difficulty.
